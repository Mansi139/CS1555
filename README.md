The goal of this project is to design and implement an electronic investing system of 401(k) retirement ac- counts. The core of such a system is a database system and a set ACID transactions. Our system, which we call “BetterFuture”, allows personal investors to buy shares of mutual funds (of stocks, bonds, or mixed of both), exchange-traded shares, and keep track of their BetterFuture investments.

We used functions, procedures, triggers and ACID transacations to achieve this goal. 

I implemented features like : Browsing mutuals funds, Searching mutual funds by text, Investing, Selling shares and Buying shares, changing allocation preferences etc.
