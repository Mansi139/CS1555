1) Price Condition Table
		Create a table to store users price conditions
		It should contain the following:
			customer--login
			price threshold
			buy or sell
			mutual fund
			amount to buy or sell
			(add other things if needed)

2) Create Trigger
		On update on the Closing Price table, check if the price threshold 
		for the mutualFund is met (look at buy/sell to see if a number meets 
		the threshold in the correct direction), then either buy/sell according to the 
		PriceConditionTable. Delete corresponding row from Price Condition Table.

3) Add Java
		Add code to add rows to Price Condition table only if 
		price condition isn't met when it's entered.
